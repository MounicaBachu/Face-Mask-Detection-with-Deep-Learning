# Face-Mask-Detection

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset

Built face mask detection system with CNN, VGG, and Inception neural network models to detect face mask from images and measured accuracy with Intersection Over Union, MAP, Test Accuracy and precision recall curve. 

Compared different deep learning models to identify the face masks on the human face in the given image.
This dataset has images from various backgrounds and with groups of people. This indirectly makes the model generic to accurately predict the face masks on real time data
